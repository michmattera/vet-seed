## **Introduction**
This is a back-end program to facilitate the job of veterinarians to calcolate and save data of subjects (in this case dogs) , calcolate if the dog is underweight, overweight or in ideal weight, in addition calcolate as well calories per day that dog should take based on weight and life stage.

The developer wanted to address a real-every-day problem or calcolation to facilitate and save data's just by answering a few questions.

This is a program created for the third of five Milestone projects required to complete the Diploma in Software development (eCommerce Applications) program at The Code Institute.
The main requirement of this project is to use  **PYTHON** as the main technology. 

## **UX**

### Ideal User demographic

Ideal user demographic for this programs are:
- Veterinarians
- People with basic info on bcs to calcolate calories per day for their dog

### User goals

Developer divided user goals for the following categories:
1. New user
2. Old user


**New user** main goal are the following:

- Understand straight away what this program can offer
- Get general information on dogs
- Be able to calcolate if my dog is overweight, underweight or ideal weight
- Calcolate which one should be the ideal weight of my dog
- Calcolate haw many calories per day I should give my dog
- See the result in a table or in a file

**Old user** main goal are the following:

- Calcolate another dog calories and ideal weight
- Update existing information of dog with new weight and progress
- Read general info again if forget something
